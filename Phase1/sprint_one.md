** Progress Update**

The Wiki file now contains detailed documentation for the login, register, and forgot password functionalities. It also includes screenshots of each UI design and explanations on how these pages integrate with each other.

We've successfully implemented the login feature and integrated it with the login page. Currently, we're focusing on implementing the register and forgot password functionalities. We anticipate completing them by the sprint deadline.

To ensure quality, we've created test cases for each of these pages and begun the testing process. We aim to finalize testing for all pages before the sprint ends.

Overall, we're well on track to achieve our sprint goals and are confident in our progress so far.
