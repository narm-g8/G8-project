** Progress Update**

This project is geared towards building a secure and user-friendly social networking platform. We're happy to report significant progress on the following features:


Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of their platform activity, including notifications, messages, and recent actions. Users can personalize their dashboard to prioritize the most relevant information.
Groups & Forums: Users can now establish public or private groups, inviting others to join. Forums within groups enable discussion threads on various topics.
Content Management (Wall): Users can now share a variety of content on the platform, encompassing events, news, polls, and images. Additionally, they have the power to determine access levels for this content, making it public, private, or accessible only to specific groups or individuals.
Comments & Engagement: Users can now comment on various content types and interact with each other through like and dislike options. This feature fosters discussion and user engagement.
Conclusion

The development of this social networking platform is progressing exceptionally well. We're proud of what we've accomplished thus far and remain dedicated to refining the platform and introducing new features to enhance the user experience.
