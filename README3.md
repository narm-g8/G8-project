## 1.Locust

Testing the performance of our chosen engine(humhub) with different tests and scripts using locust.Images and reports(graphs,csv files,...) are all accessible under locust folder. These tests iclude testing of a simple login,creating a post or updating it and it is done with 1 to 1000 users with a spawn rate of 1 or 10.


## 2.Apache jmeter

Like locust, apache jmeter is used to test the performance and load handling of our potential application.As requested, the tests between locust and apache jmeter are done similarly so that we can compare the results of bot applications and their tests.All apache jmeter reports can be found under apache-jmeter.There are four folders and in every one of them there is a summary trees folder that is related to all the listeners and the reports they have produced. in the root of every tests folder you can expect to find the csv of result table listener and the apache thread group file used for the test.There is also a folder called threads which describes the overall thread and request settings.
